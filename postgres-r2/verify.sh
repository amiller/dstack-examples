#   ./verify.sh pg-r2
#
# 1. The keys are derived, not stored — this script re-derives the superuser password from
#    the KMS and logs in with it. Nothing was handed to it.
# 2. The archive is current — how many segments, and how stale the newest one is.
# 3. The bucket holds ciphertext — the archived object is compared against a real WAL
#    segment on disk, and against the same object after wal-g decrypts it.
#
# Needs the phala CLI and a CVM deployed from docker-compose.yml here.
